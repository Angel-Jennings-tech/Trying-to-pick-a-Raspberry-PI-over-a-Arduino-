# Trying-to-pick-a-Raspberry-PI-over-a-Arduino-
overview 
Trying to decide what to use for your first mini computer for smaller miscellaneous uses? This write-up is my research I've found. While it is basic information,  it would be a great resource to choose which one to move forward with. 
Research information on the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino. What are the strengths of each platform? What are the weaknesses? How much do they cost? What additional peripherals are needed for each platform? How difficult are they to program and use? What are some interesting uses for each? Create a one-page document of your comparisons.

The Raspberry Pi is more of a full-fledged computer, whereas the Arduino is an electronic board with a simple microcontroller. Arduinos are less expensive than Raspberry Pi’s but have fewer features. The Arduino is an underperformer compared to the Raspberry Pi, with the Pi coming in at 1.6ghz depending on the board, you have Arduino coming in at 16mhz. Raspberry Pi’s range anywhere from 20$ for older versions to 80$ for the new version. Arduino’s range anywhere from 10$ to 50$. Raspberry Pis do need a separate power source, but Arduinos only need something like a USB port on your computer. They both are fairly easy, as they both come with  the downside is the Raspberry Pi doesn’t come with open source software. A Raspberry Pi is very interesting considering its size, but you can use it as a real computer or put it in a robot to become its mind. Ardinos uses cases are things that are repetitive, like turning off and on your pc or controlling LEDs and reading from sensors.
Tools used 
For this write-up up I used Google and a variety of articles 
Reflection:
I hope it helps someone save some time and learn about these great devices!
